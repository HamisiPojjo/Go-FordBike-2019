## Dataset


This data set includes information about individual rides made in a bike-sharing system covering the greater San Francisco Bay area. There are 183412 entries in the tripdata dataset with 16 feature. Some of the interesting features include the longitude and latitude of the start and end station, the trip duration in seconds, the user type, bike shared among users among others


## Summary of Findings

Most of the trips were taken during Tuesdays and Thursdays while the weekends had the least number of trips recorded.Furthermore, During the weekdays,the morning hours and evening hours ; going to work in the morning (8 and 9 hrs) and closing in the evening (17 and 18 hrs) have the highest trip records.

Interestingly, the members who didn't share their bikes during the trip covered more distance than the ones who shared their bikes. On average all the members covered around 1.7KM during the trip. Another interesting fact is that majority of the riders were male (75%) with females (23%) and others (2%) however the females spent more durations on the trip than the males. Another observation made is that only subscribers can share their bikes during the trip and not the customers and interestingly the customers (< 10%) averaged more durations during the trip than the subscribers.(around 90%).

Lastly, I discovered that Gender is among the factors that affected trip durations, where females spent more time with the bikes than Males.
The day of the week is also a factor on trip durations since trip durations on weekends are longer than on other weekdays. User type also  seems to affect the distance covered during the trip with customer user type tends to cover longer distance on their trips as compared to subscribers.


## Key Insights for Presentation


My presentation will focus on the factors affecting trip duration and distance covered. We shall deal with three factors bike_sharing, day of the week and user type.(either a customer or a subscriber). I will begin by checking the frequency of the individual variables using pie chart, seaborns countplot and histograms.

Afterwards, I would use boxplot to show relationship between bike sharing and distance covered, use barplot to show days of the week against average trip duration and lastly pointplot to show the trip distance covered across user type and bike sharing. I shall make good use of colors to ensure that the difference in qualitative variables is clear and distinctive.
